    "A tutorial was created for this project which is attached after the code. The complete code of the project can be found on the [github repository]() \n",
    "\n",
    "Here an explanation on the use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The SimpleTokenizer.py receives a text file from accessapi.py and returns a processed result. This process is done once and creates the parsed_data.pkl structure to store the resulting objects to avoid repeating unnecesary steps.\n",
    "2. When the parsed_data.pkl file doesn't exist, the SimpleTokenizer.py parses the received text to a dictionary made of a title and chunks of text smaller than 1700 words (To avoid surpassing the GPT models token limit).\n",
    "3. Accessapi.py also stores a control value in the last_processed.txt which helps to re run the script in case of failure.\n",
    "4. The accessapi.py connects to the OpenAI server and prompts the instructions with the chunks of text corresponding to a title from the generate_summary function.\n",
    "5. The summarize_streams() joins all summarized chunks together to create a single summary for each title. \n",
    "6. Resulting summaries are written to the summaries.txt file. Every time the script needs to be re run due to an error, the new summaries are appended to previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Caution: Some results may have inconsistent answers or typos. However, trial and error demonstrated that the best values to configure the model for this task are as set in accesapi.py"
